# Evaluation

Evaluation is a program to assess the accuracy of gene predictions at nucleotide, exon and gene level. 
Two input gff-files are required: 
predictions & annotations (real genes). 


## Stats
There are several measures to print about these comparisons:

### Nucleotide level:

* NuR    
* NuP      
* TP      
* TN      
* FP      
* FN    
* SN      
* SP      
* AC      
* CC 

### Exon level:

* ExR    
* ExP     
* TPe      
* ME      
* WE  
* raME    
* raWE     
* SNe     
* SPe    
* SNSP
 
### Gene level: 

* GeR    
* GeP     
* TPg      
* MG      
* WG  
* raMG    
* raWG     
* SNg     
* SPg    
* SNSPg   
* raJG    
* raSG
  
New gene level statistics are about split and join genes while remain classical and already known measures
such as specifity or sensibility. Ratios (ra) are percents in Missing/Wrong exons and genes.


## Uage & Options:

```
evaluation [-vats] <Predicted_genes.gff> <Real_genes.aff>  
```


Options are about printing:
```
        -v: Verbose. Print all messages
        -a: Average. Print average stats (more than 1 sequence)
        -t: Total. Print total stats (more than 1 sequence)
        -s: Short. Print a short output                  
```
* Short: Short version from the original standard output only with percent values at all the levels.

* Average: Arithmetic mean using the already computed values in the input sequences.

* Total: means as whether we built one artificial sequence with the previous read sequences and measured again
the percents, preserving the absolute values such as TN, TP, FN, FP, ...



                   

--------------------------

## Input format for real(annotations) and prediction files

In both files, there is a token to notice end/begin of data for more than one sequence ($)

-> Annotations:
At the beginning it is necessary one gff-line to put the length of sequence.

```
Here one script to insert $ into a gff-file is kindly provided (by G.Parra)

Script to insert "$" between sequences in a gff file with more than one sequence:
```
sort +0 -1 +3n  input.gff | gawk '{if (NR==1) ant=$1; if ($1!=ant) {print "$";ant=$1}; print }' > output.gff
```

**Caveat**: above inputs do not work with the provided C code. GFFs with multiple contigs not supported???
